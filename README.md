IMDB Sentiment Analysis
=======================

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset of 50K movie reviews. It explores different methodologies including Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Neural Networks to classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

Dataset Overview
----------------

The [IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) features 50,000 movie reviews, evenly split between 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews. This balance makes it an excellent resource for binary sentiment classification, providing a standard benchmark for evaluating model performance in natural language processing tasks.

How to Use
----------

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    *   `git clone https://github.com/AICrafter08/IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis.git`
2.  **Navigate to the Repository Folder**:
    *   `cd IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis.git`
